      # Stripe supports standard pricing (charging the same price for each unit—either 
      # one time or recurring) and Customer chooses price (letting your customer specify 
      # the price). It doesn’t support advanced options like package pricing, graduated 
      # pricing, or volume pricing. Additionally, Customer choose prices currently doesn’t 
      # support recurring payments or donations. https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/api

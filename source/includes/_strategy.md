# Data Product Strategy

The `productStrategy` object captures the business intent behind a data product and links it to a **single higher-level business KPI** it is primarily accountable for. It defines the objectives, the primary KPI at the business level, and the **product-level KPIs** that measure its direct contribution.

Optionally, it can also include **related KPIs** — secondary or cross-unit measures that:

1. **Capture additional value** — show extra benefits beyond the main KPI, useful for demonstrating broader impact.
2. **Track side effects** — monitor unintended positive or negative impacts on other KPIs.
3. **Highlight cross-department value** — reveal benefits for other business units, strengthening prioritization and funding cases.

By embedding both primary and related KPI connections directly into the product specification, `productStrategy` ensures that data products remain technically sound, strategically aligned, and transparent in how they deliver value.

| Element | Type | Options | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **productStrategy** | object | – | Top‑level block that connects the data product to business goals and KPIs. |
| **objectives** | array of objects | language‑tagged strings | Business objectives the product supports, written in natural language. |
| **contributesToKPI** | object | required | **Single higher‑level business KPI** (from SMART objectives) that this product is accountable for. |
| **id** | string | optional | Identifier of the business KPI (use shared IDs for roll‑ups). |
| **name** | string | required | KPI name. |
| **description** | string | optional | Human‑readable description. |
| **unit** | string | e.g., `percentage`, `minutes`, `s` | Unit of measurement. |
| **target** | number/string | – | Target value for the KPI. |
| **direction** | enum | `increase`, `decrease`, `at_least`, `at_most`, `equals` | Desired direction of movement. |
| **timeframe** | string | optional | When the target should be met. |
| **frequency** | string | Measurement cadence (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly). |
| **owner** | string | Responsible role/team (optional). |
| **calculation** | string | Human‑readable formula (optional). |
| **productKPIs** | array | optional | KPIs measured **at product level** that influence `contributesToKPI`. Useful for contribution analysis and governance checks. |
| **relatedKPIs** | array | optional | Secondary/cross‑unit KPIs to monitor side‑effects and additional value (informational; not for prioritization). |
| **strategicAlignment** | array | language‑tagged strings | Strategic initiatives, policies, or visions the product aligns with. |




### Governance‑by‑Design checks (Minimum Lovable Gates)

- **Required:** `contributesToKPI.name` present.  
- **Recommended:** ≥1 `productKPIs` with `unit`, `target`, and `calculation`.  
- **Optional:** `relatedKPIs` for secondary/side effects.  
- **Traceability:** use shared KPI `id`s to enable cross‑product roll‑ups against the same business KPI.

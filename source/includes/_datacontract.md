# Data Contract

The `contract` object in the ODPS schema defines the structure for linking a data product to a formal data contract. It includes an `id` as a unique identifier, a `type` field that specifies the contract standard (either ODCS or DCS), a `contractVersion` indicating the version of the standard, and a `contractURL` that points to an external contract document in a contract management service. Optionally, an inline YAML spec element can be used instead of a URL to embed the contract directly in the product file. These specifications allow data producers to clearly declare governance, usage rights, and technical expectations, supporting interoperability across platforms using standards such as the Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS) or the Data Contract Specification (DCS). More details in the [Knowledge Base](https://opendataproducts.org/howto/).

Contract can be defined in 3 ways:

* Use ODPS given attributes to define basic information of the data contract and add URL to details found in contract management system
* Same as above but add contract details as YAML on `spec` element. 
* Use `$ref` to define contract object content in a separate file.  


## Optional attributes and elements

> Example of contract object usage:

```yml
schema: https://opendataproducts.org/v4.0/schema/odps.yaml
version: 4.0
product:
  contract:
    # Optionally se URI of external file, contains all contract details
    $ref: 'https://example.org/contracts/default.yaml'
    # Or then define with attributes
    id: 02323M123  
    type:  ODCS 
    contractVersion:  2.2.2
    contractURL: https://demo.datamesh-manager.com/demo834016807886/dataproducts/9bd53b1b-b51e-41a8-a757-4d33b4cde460
    # Or use inline style and add contract under spec element
    spec:
        ....


```

| <div style="width:150px">Element name</div>   | Type  | Options  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **contract**  | element | - | Binds together data contract details. You can use both URL and inline (YAML) for data contract content. | 
| **id**  | string | - | UUID of the data contract | 
| **type**  | string | one of: ODCS, DCS | Defines the standard used in data contract. Currently supported options: [ODCS](https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard) and [DCS](https://datacontract.com/). | 
| **contractVersion**  | string | - | Version of the standard used to define the Data Contract. Type attribute defines the standard/specification. NOTE! This is not the possible iterated version of the data contract itself. | 
| **contractURL**  | URL | Valid URL. See more from [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986). | URL pointing to data contract in data contract management service or alike. Optionally you can use _spec_ to add data contract details as YAML inline element. | 
| **spec**  | string | YAML | Inline YAML element to add data contract details instead of using URL. | 
| **$ref**  | URI | Valid URI | Points to the contract content, local file or online. You can use this or then the other above described approaches to define elements of the contract.

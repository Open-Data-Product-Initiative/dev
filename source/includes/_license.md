# Data Licensing

Data product licensing is essential for ensuring legal compliance, protecting intellectual property rights, enabling monetization and commercialization, facilitating control and governance, managing liability and indemnification, promoting standardization and interoperability, and fostering transparency and trust in data exchange and collaboration. By establishing clear and enforceable licensing agreements, data producers and consumers can effectively leverage data assets while minimizing legal risks and maximizing the value of data products.

The data product may be exploited e.g. by licensing its use and exploitation to third parties. Machine-readable license as part of the specification is implemented for this purpose. It can be used to conclude various agreements regarding data protection, processing and intellectual property rights (IPR). Data can be protected by one or more intellectual property rights. Principle is that when a third party (Data User) exploits the data, it must have a license or other right from Data Holder to exploit the data.

| <div style="width:150px">Element name</div>   | Type  | Options  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **license** | element | - |  Binds the licensing related elements and attributes together. |
| **$ref**  | URI | Valid URI | Points to the license text, local file or online. You can use this or then the other approach to define elements of the license with below given elements and attributes |
| **en** | attribute | [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) defined 2-letter codes | This element binds together other product attributes and expresses the langugage used. In the example this is "en", which indicates that product details are in English. If you would like to use Arabic details, then name the element "ar". The naming of this element follows options (language codes) listed in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard. <br/><br/> You can have product details in multiple languages simply by adding similar sets like the example - just change the binding element name to matching language code. <br/><br/> The pattern to implement multilanguage support for data products was adopted from de facto UI translation practices. The attributes inside this element are commonly rendered in the UI for the consumer and providing a simple way to implement that was the driving reasoning. See for example  [JSON - Multi Language](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/file-formats/multi-language-json/) |
| **scope** | element | - |  Extent, range, coverage, area or space of the license. |
| **definition** | string | text content, max length 512 chars  | Background and purpose of the license. |

| **termination** | element | - | Licence termination and continuity related conditions. |

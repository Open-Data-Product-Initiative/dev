      valueProposition: Enable smarter city experiences by providing structured, real-time

        smart city services.
      description: UrbanPulse Events is a SmartCity data product that aggregates and structures 
        public event information — concerts, exhibitions, festivals, sports events — 
        making it accessible through APIs and dashboards for internal and future external use.

      versionNotes: Initial partner release with basic event metadata structure and shadow 
        pricing model implemented.

        feeds and metadata enrichment.
